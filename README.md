## Getting Started

To use MediMate, follow these steps:

- Clone the MediMate repository from GitHub.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CharCoders/LiveTheCode.git
```
- Install the required dependencies for the frontend and backend specified in the documentation. You must have `node.js` installed.

For Linux:
```bash
cd LiveTheCode/frontend/ && npm install
```

> **Important**  
> The backend is not linked to the frontend intentionally, since it is already hosted on a remote server whose address is already hardcoded in `vite.config.js`.


For Windows:
```powershell
cd .\LiveTheCode\frontend\; npm install
```
- Specify your HuggingFace credentials in `chatbot.py`. You can remove them after the initialization.

> **Note**  
> The credentials are only used for the initial run, the cookies are saved in `usercookies/<user>.json`.

To run locally:

For Linux:
```bash
cd LiveTheCode/frontend/ && npm run dev
